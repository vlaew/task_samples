## Ruby on Rails challenge

### Description

There is a hypothetical mobile app that needs the following functionality:

 - Display a list of posts
 - Like/dislike a post by a current user
 - Display "heart" icon if a post has been liked by a current user
 - Display number of likes that a post has
 - Display "comment" and "publication date" of a post
 
Your task is to design, implement and document HTTP JSON API for this
hypothetical mobile app.

You should use Ruby on Rails web framework.

### Expectations

Please send us an archived directory containing app sources. The archive
should include everything needed to run the application. If you have any
notes, feel free to put them into README.md file inside of your directory.

The rails app should fully implement the described functionality.
Code clarity and a potential scalability is very important to us. Here's
where you can shine.

We also would like to see a few unit tests covering the most important
parts of the app of your choice.
